"""Background runner for ``--web-bg`` mode.

When ``conductor run --web-bg`` or ``conductor resume --web-bg`` is used, this
module forks a detached child process that runs the workflow with ``--web``
enabled, then the parent process prints the dashboard URL and exits
immediately.

The child process is fully detached (new session on Unix, new process group on
Windows) so it outlives the parent. It auto-shuts down after the workflow
completes and all WebSocket clients disconnect (the existing ``--web`` +
``bg=True`` behavior in ``WebDashboard``).

The child's stdout and stderr are redirected into log files under
``$TMPDIR/conductor/`` (not ``DEVNULL``) so a silent crash — an uncaught
Python exception, a ``faulthandler`` dump, or anything else the child
would normally write to ``sys.stderr`` — leaves a forensic trail. See
issue #116 for context.

This is also why we deliberately do NOT pass ``--silent`` to the child
even though no human is watching its console: ``--silent`` would also
set ``verbose_mode=False``, which gates provider-side SDK event logging
that ``--log-file`` writes to disk. Leaving verbosity at the default and
capturing the stream to a file keeps both the log files and any
``--log-file`` trace populated for detached children (see issue #196).

    The child executes ``conductor resume <workflow|--from path> --web ...``
    with all the caller-supplied options. ``--no-interactive`` is always
    appended since the detached child has no TTY. The parent waits briefly
    for the web server to become reachable, then returns the dashboard URL
    and the path to the child's captured stderr log.

    Either ``workflow_path`` or ``checkpoint_path`` (or both) must be
    provided — at least one is required by the resume command.

    Args:
        workflow_path: Optional path to the workflow YAML file. Used to find
            the latest checkpoint when ``checkpoint_path`` is not given.
        checkpoint_path: Optional explicit path to a checkpoint file.
        provider_override: Optional provider name override.
        skip_gates: Whether to auto-select first option at human gates.
        log_file: Optional log file path.
        web_port: Desired port (0 = auto-select).
        metadata: Optional CLI metadata key=value pairs.

    Returns:
        A ``BackgroundLaunch`` describing the launch (dashboard URL,
        captured stderr/stdout log paths, run id).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If neither ``workflow_path`` nor ``checkpoint_path`` is
            provided.
